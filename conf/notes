	change the data source to tilejson url https://tileserver.cyclemap.us/data/v3.json


see update.sh

to fix an incorrect max zoom level:  sqlite3 tiles.mbtiles 'update metadata set value="13" where name="maxzoom";'
data about tiles:  sqlite3 tiles.mbtiles 'select value from metadata where name in ("maxzoom", "bounds"); select zoom_level, sum(length(tile_data)) from tiles group by zoom_level;'

$ du -sm data/tiles.mbtiles
338	bc63a22 level 14
347	data/tiles.mbtiles


TODO
	fix paths
		change color of paths, (orange?)
		make them come it at the same zoom level as tertiary roads,
		make tertiary roads wider
		put tertiary roads in front of paths

	make scale wider
	make key go even further right than you think it should?

TIMING
	basically https is the real thing making stuff slow.  no need to make tile server cache yet.
	exceptions:  (timing information isn't in logs anymore) grep ... logs/access.log
